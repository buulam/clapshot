# gRPC + Proto3 library for Clapshot

This is a mostly autogenerated library for Clapshot server, and
also for any Organizer plugins written in Rust.

It provides a library that is then imported in
server and organizer Cargo.toml files, centralizing the
dependencies and the gRPC/protobuf boilerplate code.

## License

Unlike the server, this library is licensed under the MIT license,
to relieve plugins from GPL's copyleft requirements.
