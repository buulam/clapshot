# gRPC + Proto3 library for Clapshot

This is a mostly autogenerated library for Clapshot server, and
also for any Organizer plugins written in Rust.

Its purpose is to centralize these dependencies and to reduce
the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written for
gRPC and protobuf.

It provides a library that is then imported in
server and organizer Cargo.toml files.
