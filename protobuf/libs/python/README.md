# gRPC + Proto3 library for Clapshot, in Python 3.11+

This is a mostly autogenerated library for Clapshot Organizer plugins written in Python.

## Structure

The main directory contains a Makefile that automates the generation of Python gRPC bindings from Protocol Buffers (`.proto` files).
The generated bindings, along with custom utility functions, are then packaged into a Python module which can be
installed using `pip` by any Python-based Organizer plugins.

## Usage

To generate the Python module, simply run: `make`
See the 'basic_folders' Organizer for how to actually import and use this library.

## Note

The necessary Python files for gRPC communication are generated with `protoc` and organized on-the-fly by the Makefile,
so you won't see them in the repository until the build process is run.

## License (MIT)

Released under the **MIT license**, unlike the main server (which is GPLv2) so you can use this as a basis for custom, proprietary extensions.
