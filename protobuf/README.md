The `proto/` directory contains protobuffer structure and gRPC function definitions
that are used for server <-> frontend and server <-> organizer plugin communication in Clapshot.

You can generate strongly typed code for working with Protobuffer and gRPC in many languages,
including Rust and Typescript. The `libs/` directory contains scripts for this.
