# Basic folder organizer plugin for Clapshot

Also serves a **default/example implementation** of the Clapshot Organizer API.
This is written in Python, but you can write your own Organizer in any language that supports gRPC.

## License (MIT)

Unlike the main server (which is GPLv2), this plugin is released under the
**MIT license**, so you can use it as a basis for custom, proprietary
extensions.
